<h1 align="center"> <u>My own thoughts towards depletion of the environment</u>
<h2> As we know , today we are facing a lot of problems due to depletion of the environment by various causes. Due to overpopulation, overexploitaion etc. there is a gradual degradation of the environment and these depletion of the environment will cause various diseases harmful to human beings as well as animals , insects etc. So inorder to prevent depletion of the environment, here are some points which I would like to share.
<ul type ="disk">
<li>To prevent depletion of the environment , Government should set up certain programmes especially for the students so that they are awared about the environment depletion. Aslo there should be trips provided for the students  like "Grow more trees programs" </li>
<li>Environment conservation starts from an individual. Every individual in the society should start to look after the environment by following points given.<ol> <li type="1"> <font color="red" >Turn off your devices when it is not use  to save energy</font> </li>
<li><font color="orange">Follow THREE R's which stands for reduce,reuse, recycle.</font></li>
<li> <font color="blue"> Use bicycle or go to the shop or any nearby place by walking which will help in saving the fuel of the vehicle.</font></li>
<li><font color="violet"> Plant more trees in your locality and do not allow any person to burn firewood or any material in your locality</font></li>
<li><font color="indigo"> Use reusabel items and keep separate dustbins for degradable and non-biodegradable materials</font></li></ol>
<li>Government should enroll certain authorities in the village . These authorities should tell the people in the village regarding the importance of the environment , and also they should tell them about the ways to prevent environment degradation</li>
