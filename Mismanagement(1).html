<h3 align="left">Human beings impact the physical environment in many ways: overpopulation, pollution, burning fossil fuels, and deforestation. Changes like these have triggered climate change, soil erosion, poor air quality, and undrinkable water. <br>These negative impacts can affect human behavior and can prompt mass migrations or battles over clean water.<br>The environmental impact of mining includes erosion, formation of sinkholes, loss of biodiversity, and contamination of soil, groundwater and surface water by chemicals from mining processes . Human activity is causing environmental degradation, which is the deterioration of the environment through depletion of resources such as air, water and soil; the destruction of ecosystems; habitat destruction; the extinction of wildlife; and pollution.<br> Growth in human populations increased conversion of natural ecosystems to agricultural, industrial, residential use and demand for ecosystem inputs, such as fresh water, fiber, and soil fertility, as well as increased pressure on the capacity of natural ecosystems.Deforestation, expanding agriculture, illegal fishing and hunting, unplanned tourism, and pollution by pesticides have also caused a progressive deterioration of natural habitats.The consequence is loss of biodiversity, removal of forest that eliminates food and shelter.Fresh water is crucial to life on Earth, yet more sources are being polluted through human activities each year. Due to urbanisation environment is drastically affected . Due to establishment of factories , leading to release of harmful gases . Due to release of harmful gases results in ozone layer depletion.Air pollution is becoming an increasingly dangerous problem, particularly in heavily-populated cities.An ever-growing population needs transportation, much of which is fueled by the natural resources that emit greenhouse gases, such as petroleum. </h3>
