<h2> The Environment is our basic life support system and is composed of living beings, physical surroundings, and climatic conditions. It is derived from a French word, “Environner”, which means “to surround”. The term environment includes all biotic and abiotic entities around us. Biotic refers to the world of living organisms, whereas Abiotic refers to the world of non-living elements. The Environment provides us the basic elements – air, water, food, and land which are essential for life to flourish on the Earth.<br>The Environment is our basic life support system and is composed of living beings, physical surroundings, and climatic conditions.

<br>Humans form an integral part of the environment. They interact with the environment and modify it as per their needs and requirements, thus forming a human-made environment. With time, as humans evolved, their interaction with the environment also revolutionized, resulting in global environmental impact. Early humans used to adapt to the natural surroundings, however, contemporarily, as the human needs grew and became varied, the pressure on the environment also spiked and more emphasis was given on judiciously using our environmental resources for meeting the needs of both present and future generations, to safeguard biodiversity and to protect life on Earth. Our Environmental resources are finite, living in harmony, and maintaining a perfect balance between the natural and human environment is of utmost importance and is the only way forward to a sustainable future.</h2>
